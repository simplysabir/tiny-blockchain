# **Tiny Blockchain**

Tiny Blockchain is a simple blockchain implementation written in Rust. It provides a basic framework for creating and managing a blockchain, complete with transactions, proof-of-work mining, and adjustable parameters such as difficulty and mining rewards.

## Features

- **Transaction Management:** Allows users to create and manage transactions between different addresses.
- **Proof-of-Work Mining:** Implements a proof-of-work algorithm to mine new blocks for the blockchain.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Users can adjust the difficulty level for mining to control the rate at which new blocks are added to the blockchain.
- **Reward System:** Provides a reward to the miner for successfully mining a new block.


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/simplysabir/tiny-blockchain.git
cd tiny-blockchain
```

2. **Build the Project:**
```
cargo build
```

3. **Run the Application:**
```
cargo run
```

4. **Follow the on-screen instructions:** Input the miner address, difficulty level, and use the menu to perform various actions like creating transactions, mining blocks, adjusting difficulty, and changing rewards.


## Usage
- **New Transaction (Menu Option 1):** Add a new transaction to the current transaction pool.
- **Mine Block (Menu Option 2):** Mine a new block by solving the proof-of-work algorithm. This includes rewarding the miner.
- **Change Difficulty (Menu Option 3):** Adjust the difficulty level for mining.
- **Change Reward (Menu Option 4):** Modify the reward given to the miner for successfully mining a block.
- **Exit (Menu Option 0):** Quit the application.
